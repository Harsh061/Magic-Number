Magic-Number
============

                                    This is my First Repository.
  
   This repository is about a magic. 
   Suppose you have to imagine any number between 1-100.
   Now if the number is present in the console screen then you have to press 'y' for YES & 'n' for  NO .
   At the end of the magic i will tell you which number you imagined.
