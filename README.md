Magic-Number
============

                                    This is my First Repository.
  *This repository is about a magic. 
  *Suppose you have to imagine any number between 1-60.
  *Now if the number is present in the console screen then you have to press 'y' for YES & 'n' for  NO .
  *At the end of the magic i will tell you which number you imagined.
